The mechanical components of the refueling/charging robot in this project can be broadly classified into three main categories: the tracked mobile chassis, the main and auxiliary robotic arms, and the tool placement table. These components are mounted on the chassis and are illustrated in the [figure1](../images/oil_robot2.png) and [figure2](../images/oil_robot3.png).
